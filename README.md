## Description
Our project is called TIMBY – which is short for Tour In My Back Yard.
Have you ever wondered what locals do in Vancouver, Seattle or even New York for fun? Wouldn’t you want to experience the city as a local or with locals. Who better to guide you than genuine locals.
With TIMBY, our goal is to create authentic experiences for travellers by connecting them with locals and at the same time for locals to share their secret hot-spots while making income on the side.
